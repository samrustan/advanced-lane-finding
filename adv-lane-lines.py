#
# Compute camera calibration matrix and distortion coeffs using checkerboard.
## object points

## termination criteria

## object/image points arrays

## make list of calibration images


# Apply distortion correction to raw images

# Create a thresholded binary image

# Apply Perspective Transform (to overhead view)

# Detect lane pixels and fit to find lane boundary

# Determine curvature of lane and vehicle postion wrt image center

# Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the orig image.

# Output visual display: lane lines, lane curvature, vehicle position
